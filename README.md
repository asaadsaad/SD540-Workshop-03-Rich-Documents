### SD540-Workshop-03-Rich-Documents
Database as a service (DBaaS) is a cloud computing service model that provides access to a database without the need to manage the underlying infrastructure. Create your [MongoDB Atlas account here](https://www.mongodb.com/atlas), and use Atlas DBaaS instance.
  
#### Add new features to SD540-MongoDB-02 homework:
Write a function to find all of the published posts and paginate the results using [Mongoose paginate v2 plugin](https://www.npmjs.com/package/mongoose-paginate-v2). All Mongoose Schemas are pluggable, they allow applying pre-packaged capabilities to extend their functionality. Plugins are a tool for reusing logic in multiple schemas.
#### Learn about Indexes:
Read [MongoDB documentation](https://www.mongodb.com/docs/manual/indexes/) and the [provided guide](./DB-Indices.pdf) to learn about Indexes and answer the following questions:
  * What are indexes and why do we need them?
  * When do we create an index?
  * How do we create an index?
  * What is the default index all collections have?
  * How many indexes can we create within a single collection?
  * What data structure does MongoDB use for an index?
  * What is the time complexity for find, insert, and delete operations?
  * List a few types of indexes MongoDB supports.
  * Suggest a way to improve the performance of the previous find published posts query.
